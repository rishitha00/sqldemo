/*Data is information such as facts and numbers used to analyze something or make decisions.*/
/*
Database is merely a structured collection of data.
Database is a collection of inter-related Tables.
Table is a collection of Records.
Record is a collection of fields.

The data relating to each other by nature, e.g., a product belonged to a product 
category and associated with multiple tags. Therefore, we use the term relational database.
A table may relate to another table using a relationship

-- The WHERE clause allows you to specify a search condition for the rows

/*  SELECT 
    select_list
FROM
    table_name
WHERE
    search_condition;  */

/* The search_condition is a combination of one or more predicates using the 
logical operator AND, OR and NOT.

AND- All conditions should be TRUE
OR - Any one of the conditions should be TRUE.
NOT - Negate the Condition .
 */

-- OR operator
 -- query finds employees whose job title is Sales Rep or employees who 
 -- locate the office with office code 1:
SELECT employeeNumber,lastname,firstname,jobTitle,email,officeCode 
	from employees 
		WHERE jobTitle='Sales Rep' OR officeCode=1;

-- The BETWEEN operator returns TRUE if a value is in a range of values:
 
 -- Syntax: expression BETWEEN low AND high
 
 -- query finds employees who locate in offices whose office code is from 1 to 3:
SELECT employeeNumber,lastname,firstname,jobTitle,email,officeCode

# MySQL WHERE with the LIKE operator
 
 /* The LIKE operator evaluates to TRUE if a value matches a specified pattern. 
 To form a pattern, you use % and _ wildcards. 
 The % wildcard matches any string of zero or more characters 
 while the _ wildcard matches any single character. */

#MySQL WHERE clause with the IN operator

-- The IN operator returns TRUE if a value matches any value in a list.
-- Syntax
-- value IN (value1, value2,...)

-- IN condition is used to help reduce the need to use multiple OR conditions in a 
-- SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.

#MySQL WHERE  clause with the IS NULL operator
-- Null -> Absence of Data or Data is missing

/* To check if a value is NULL or not, you use the IS NULL operator, 
not the equal operator (=). The IS NULL operator returns TRUE if a value is NULL.

Syntax:

#MySQL ORDER BY clause
-- When you use the SELECT statement to query data from a table, 
-- the result set is not sorted. It means that the rows in the result set can 
-- be in any order.

-- To sort the result set, you add the ORDER BY clause to the SELECT statement
/* Syntax:
SELECT   select_list FROM    table_name
ORDER BY 
   column1 [ASC|DESC], 
   column2 [ASC|DESC],
   ...;  */

# MySQL GROUP BY clause
 -- The GROUP BY clause groups a set of rows into a set of summary rows by values 
 -- of columns or expressions. The GROUP BY clause returns one row for each group. 
 -- In other words, it reduces the number of rows in the result set.
 
 /* You often use the GROUP BY clause with aggregate functions such as SUM, AVG, 
 MAX, MIN, and COUNT. The aggregate function that appears in the SELECT clause 
 provides information about each group. */
 
 /* Syntax: 
 SELECT c1, c2,..., cn, aggregate_function(ci)
FROM table
WHERE where_conditions
GROUP BY c1 , c2,...,cn; */

 /* The GROUP BY clause is often used with an aggregate function to perform calculation and 
return a single value for each subgroup. */

# SQL Joins
-- A join is a method of linking data between one (self-join) or 
-- more tables based on values of the common column between the tables.

/* MySQL supports the following types of joins:

Inner join
Left join
Right join
Cross join */

-- Inner Join - Returns only matching records from 2 tables

/* SELECT
    select_list
FROM t1
INNER JOIN t2 ON join_condition1
INNER JOIN t3 ON join_condition2
...; */
